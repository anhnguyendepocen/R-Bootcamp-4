The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. There are a number of other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.

Flip cartesian coordinates so that horizontal becomes vertical, and vertical, horizontal:

`coord_flip()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

Or similarly with violin plots:

```{r}
violin <- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill=class, alpha = 1/2), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 1/3) 

violin
```

```{r}
violin + coord_flip()
```


* `coord_polar()`

```{r}
bar <- ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, fill = cut), show.legend = FALSE, width = 1) +
  labs(x= NULL, 
       title = "Distribution of diamonds based on cut",
       subtitle = "Data: ggplot2::diamonds") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)

bar + coord_flip()
```

```{r}
bar + coord_polar()
```

## Exercise
What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```
