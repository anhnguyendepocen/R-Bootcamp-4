### Exercise 1
What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

----

### Exercise 2
What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

-----

### Exercise 3
What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behavior?

----

### Exercise 4
What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

----

### Exercise 5
Use `position_jitter()` to modify the amount of jittering. What parameters in `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

----

### Exercise 6
Compare `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

----

### Exercise 7
We haven't plotted a boxplot yet, check out the documentation for `geom_boxplot()` and look at some the examples. What's the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
