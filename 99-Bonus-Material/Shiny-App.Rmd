```{r message=FALSE}
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```

## Running an App
My `hist-shiny` is stored in a folder with the same name. We will use the folder name to call the app:

```{r message=FALSE}
runApp("hist-shiny")
```

Stop the app and make some changes:

1. Change the title from “Hello Shiny!” to “Hello World!”.

2. Set the minimum value of the slider bar to 5

3. Change the histogram border color from "white" to "orange".
