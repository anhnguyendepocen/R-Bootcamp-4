### Exercise 1
Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?

To answer these questions try to modify the plots from the notebook by changing the parameters.

----

### Exercise 2
What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

----

### Exercise 3
What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

```
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

### Exercise 4
What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
