1. How many rows are in `mpg`?
2. How many columns?
3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.
4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.
5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(paste0("Number of rows: ", nrow(mpg)))
print(paste0("Number of columns: ", ncol(mpg)))
```

One could also use `glimpse()`:

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```


```{r}
?mpg
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=hwy, y=cyl))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=class, y=drv)) + geom_point()
```
